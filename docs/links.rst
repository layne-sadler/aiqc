Lend a hand in building the next generation of open source machine learning, meet people, bolster your resume, beef up your skills, come learn something new, or just talk shop!

Jump in the Slack channel in the links above to say hello. All are welcome.

Machine learning is a broad space with plenty of challenges to solve. Have a look at the `Compatibility Matrix <compatibility.html>`_ to see what needs to be addressed and let us know if you want to get involved. Help build something that isn't lame.

We plan to host monthly dev jam sessions and data science lightning talks. It's more fun to hack in a group.
